# Hello-world

Hello, new world of programming!

Definitely only new to me, but if I don't get rid of this big fear monster in my mind, I know nothing's ever going to change on its own.
No one developed yet a neural link with the internet, that allow's me to learn everything, so I need to puff my chest to face the intimidating, but fascinating field of programs.
