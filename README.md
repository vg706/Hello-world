# Hello-GitHub

Hello, new world of programming!

Definitely only new to me, but if I don't get rid of this big fear monster in my mind, I know nothing's ever going to change on its own.
No one developed yet a neural link with the internet, that allow's me to learn everything, so I need to puff my chest to face the intimidating, but fascinating field of programs.
I'm interested in game development and robotics, but willing to expand my knowledge across any language I have the opportunity.
An interesting fact is that most of the learning process I'm going through actually comes from the internet, not the t.i course I attend at school, but it keeps me aware of my responsibilities.  
Hoping to keep track of my personal development, while also getting to know the community and exchanging experiences.
